## 4. ROI Calculations — 3, 5, and 10-Year Horizons

### Base Case Scenario (Long-Term Rental)
*Assumptions: 4% annual rent growth, 5% annual capital appreciation, AED 45K starting rent*

#### 3-Year ROI

| Component | Amount (AED) |
|---|---|
| Total rental income (3 years) | 141,000 |
| Total operating costs (3 years) | (48,000) |
| **Net rental income** | **93,000** |
| Property appreciation (5%/yr compounded) | 868,219 - 750,000 = **118,219** |

---

### Bull Case (7% annual appreciation, strong rental market)

| Horizon | Total Return (AED) | ROI | Annualized |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 years | 269,000 | 32.4% | 10.8% |
| 5 years | 487,000 | 58.7% | 11.7% |
| 10 years | 1,196,000 | 144.1% | 14.4% |

## 5. Off-Plan Payment Plan Cash Flow Analysis

### Danube 1% Monthly Plan (Business Bay Example)

**Property Price:** AED 750,000

| Phase | Payment | Amount (AED) | Timeline |
|---|---|---|---|
| Booking | 20% | 150,000 | At signing |
| Construction (monthly) | 1% × 30 months | 7,500/month | During construction |
| Handover | Balance | ~375,000 | At handover |
| **OR Post-handover** | 1% × 50 months | 7,500/month | After handover |

**Monthly cash flow during construction:** -7,500 AED
**Monthly cash flow post-handover (with rent):** +45,000/12 - 7,500 - 1,300 (costs) = **-5,050** (still negative!) → breakeven at ~month 18 when post-handover payments end

### Standard 20/60/20 Plan (Samana/Binghatti Example)

| Phase | Payment | Amount (AED) | Timeline |
|---|---|---|---|
| Booking | 20% | 150,000 | At signing |
| Construction milestones | 60% | 450,000 | 18-24 months (staged) |
| Handover | 20% | 150,000 | On completion |

**Construction phase monthly outflow:** ~AED 25,000/month (averaged)

---

## 6. Mortgage Comparison

### If Financing Post-Handover:

| Term | Detail |
|---|---|
| Max LTV (non-resident) | 50-60% of property value |
| Typical interest rate | 4.5-6.0% (variable) |
| For 750K at 50% LTV | AED 375,000 mortgage |
| Monthly payment (25-year) | ~AED 2,200-2,400 |
| Monthly rent income | ~AED 3,750 |
| Monthly cash flow | +AED 1,350-1,550 (positive!) |

### Cash Purchase vs. Mortgage:

| Metric | Cash Purchase | 50% Mortgage |
|---|---|---|
| Total capital deployed | 830,000 | ~455,000 |
| Monthly cash flow | +2,450 | +1,350 |
| Net yield on capital | 3.5% | 3.6% |
| Leverage benefit | None | Property appreciates on full value |
| 5-year ROI on capital | 44.6% | ~81.4% |
| Risk | Lower | Higher (loan obligations) |

> **Key insight:** Mortgage leverage dramatically improves ROI on deployed capital, but adds risk of negative cash flow if vacancy occurs or rates rise.

## 7. Tax Implications

### Dubai (UAE)
- ✅ **Zero income tax** — all rental income is tax-free in UAE
- ✅ **Zero capital gains tax** — property sales are tax-free
- ✅ **Zero property tax** — no annual property tax (only service charges)
- 5% **VAT** on commercial property (residential is exempt)
- 4% **DLD transfer fee** on purchase (essentially a one-time "tax")

### Home Country Considerations (Israel)
- 🔴 **Israeli tax residents** are taxed on **worldwide income**
- 🔴 Rental income from Dubai property is taxable in Israel
- 🔴 Capital gains on foreign property sale are taxable
- 🟡 Foreign tax credits may be available (but UAE charges no tax, so no credit)
- 🟡 Tax treaty between Israel and UAE (signed 2021) may provide some relief
- 🔴 Reporting obligations: Must declare foreign property ownership and income to Israeli Tax Authority
- 🔴 Israeli capital gains tax: **25% on real capital gain** for foreign investment property
- 🟡 **Two rental income tax options (choose the lower one):**
  - **Option A — 15% flat rate** (Section 122A, Israeli Tax Ordinance): No deductions allowed. Simple. Most small landlords choose this.
  - **Option B — Marginal tax rate with deductions:** Can deduct building depreciation (2% of building value per year, excluding land), maintenance, management fees, insurance, etc. Better if deductions are high or other income is low.
- 🟡 **Building depreciation:** 2% of the building component per year (not land value). On a 500K AED property where ~80% is building: ~8,000 AED/year deductible under Option B.

### Estimated Israeli Tax Impact (Motor City ~500K, rent 56K/yr):

**Option A — 15% Flat Rate (simpler, usually chosen):**

| Item | Gross Amount (AED) | Israeli Tax | Net After Tax |
|---|---|---|---|
| Annual rent | 56,000 | 15% = ~8,400 | 47,600 |
| Capital gain (5yr, ~108K) | 108,000 | 25% = ~27,000 | 81,000 |

**Option B — Marginal Rate with Deductions (example):**

| Item | Amount (AED) |
|---|---|
| Annual rent | 56,000 |
| Less: Depreciation (2% × 400K building) | (8,000) |
| Less: Service charges, maintenance | (8,500) |
| Taxable income | 39,500 |
| Tax at marginal rate (depends on brackets) | Varies |

> 💡 **Most small landlords choose Option A (15% flat)** — it's simpler and often lower unless you have very high deductible expenses or low marginal tax rates.

> ⚠️ **Consult a cross-border tax advisor** — Israeli tax on foreign rental income and capital gains can significantly reduce returns. There may be optimization strategies (LLC structure, timing of gains, depreciation schedules).

## 8. Sensitivity Analysis

### What Happens If...

| Scenario | Impact on 5-Year ROI |
|---|---|
| Rents drop 10% | ROI drops from 44.6% to 37.8% |
| Rents increase 8%/yr | ROI increases to 56.2% |
| 12-month vacancy in Year 1 | ROI drops to 39.2% |
| Property value drops 15% | ROI drops to 21.4% |
| Property value increases 10%/yr | ROI increases to 70.1% |
| 2-year delay in handover | ROI drops to 38.5% (lost rent) |
| AED/USD peg breaks | Hard to predict; AED is pegged to USD |

---

## 9. Break-Even Analysis

### When Do You Recover Your Investment?

| Scenario | Break-Even Period |
|---|---|
| With 5% annual appreciation | ~7-8 years |
| With 7% annual appreciation | ~5-6 years |
| With 0% appreciation (rent only) | ~15-18 years |
| With short-term rental premium | ~5-7 years |

### Monthly Break-Even Rent:

To cover ALL costs (service charges, maintenance, vacancy, management):
- **Minimum monthly rent needed:** AED 1,400-1,700 (~AED 17,000-20,000/year)
- **Current market rents:** AED 3,500-4,500/month
- **Healthy margin above break-even**

---

## Key Financial Takeaways

1. **Expected 5-year annualized ROI: 8-9%** in the base case — competitive globally
2. **Dubai is tax-free** but Israeli rental tax (15% flat) and capital gains tax (25%) will reduce returns by ~15-20%
3. **1% monthly payment plans** are excellent for cash flow management
4. **Budget AED 80K+ above property price** for DLD fees, furnishing, and initial costs
5. **Mortgage leverage** can significantly boost ROI but adds risk
6. **Vacancy is your biggest near-term risk** — furnish attractively and price competitively
7. **The first 2 years** post-handover are critical — establish rental history and tenant base
8. **Short-term rentals** can boost yields 30-50% but require more active management
