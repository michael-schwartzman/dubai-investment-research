# Dubai Studio Apartment Investment — Executive Summary

*Last updated: February 2026*
*Budget: ~750,000 AED | Off-plan studio | Investor visa + Rental yield + Appreciation*

---

## ⚡ Key Findings

### 1. Visa Reality Check
- **750K AED does NOT qualify for the Golden Visa** (minimum: AED 2,000,000)
- It DOES qualify for a **2-year renewable property visa** (after handover + title deed)
- Strategy: Buy at 750K now → purchase second property later → reach 2M for Golden Visa
- Off-plan properties generally don't qualify for any visa until handover

### 2. Best Areas for Your Budget
- **Best yield:** Motor City, JVC, Arjan, DSO (7.5-10.5% gross)
- **Best appreciation:** Business Bay, MBR City (50-70% over last 5 years)
- **Best balance:** JVC (strong yield + decent appreciation + huge selection)
- **Safest bet:** JLT (established community, metro, low supply risk, 7-8% yield, immediate rental income)
- **Best future bet:** Dubai South / Expo City (cheap now, massive government investment ahead)
- **Hidden gem:** Motor City (~10.2% yield, spacious studios, low supply risk, established community)
- **Community pick:** JVT (Nakheel gated community, ~8.3% yield, family-friendly, quieter alternative to JVC)
- **Biggest risk:** JVC and Arjan (heavy oversupply of 15,000+ units expected 2025-2027)

### 3. Market Timing
- Current market is STRONG — prices up 40-70% from 2020 lows
- We may be near-peak in the cycle — proceed with caution
- Off-plan still offers value vs. secondary market
- Budget for 6-12 month delivery delays regardless of developer claims

### 4. Financial Returns
- **Expected 5-year annualized ROI: 8-9%** (base case, gross)
- **Expected 10-year ROI: 100%+** (doubling your money including rent + appreciation)
- **Net yield after costs: 4-6%** (after service charges, vacancy, management)
- **⚠️ Israeli tax reduces returns by ~25%** on rental income and capital gains
- **Total acquisition cost: ~AED 830K** (property + DLD 4% + fees + furnishing)

### 5. Developer Landscape
- **Safest:** Emaar, Sobha, Ellington (but limited studios at 750K)
- **Best value:** Samana (private pools), Danube (1% monthly plans), Binghatti (unique design)
- **Avoid:** Object 1, very new developers with zero delivery track record
- **Service charge watch:** DAMAC charges are 30-50% higher than competitors — eat into yields
