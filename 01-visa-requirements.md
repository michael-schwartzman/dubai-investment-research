## 2. Does 750,000 AED Qualify?

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: NO — 750K AED Does NOT Qualify for Golden Visa

**The minimum is AED 2,000,000.** At 750K AED, you fall short by AED 1,250,000.

### Options to Bridge the Gap:
1. **Multiple properties:** You can combine the value of multiple properties to reach AED 2M. Buy a 750K studio now + purchase additional property later
2. **Property appreciation:** If your off-plan property appreciates to AED 2M+ by handover, you *may* qualify (based on DLD valuation, not purchase price)
3. **Standard Property Visa (not Golden):** Dubai offers a 2-year renewable residence visa for property valued at **AED 750,000+** — this IS within your budget

## 3. Standard Property/Investor Residence Visa (2-Year)

### Requirements (more achievable at 750K budget)
| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Minimum property value | **AED 750,000** (changed from AED 1M in some emirates) |
| Property type | Completed (handed over), freehold |
| Duration | **2 years**, renewable |
| Sponsor needed | No (self-sponsored through property) |
| Family sponsorship | Spouse + children (under 18, or daughters until marriage) |
| Work permission | Does NOT include work permit — separate arrangement needed |

### ⚠️ Important Caveats for Off-Plan:
- The standard 2-year property visa generally requires a **completed property** (title deed issued)
- Off-plan properties typically do NOT qualify until handover and title deed registration
- Some developers and banks may facilitate interim arrangements

---

## 4. Off-Plan Property & Visa Eligibility

### Golden Visa (AED 2M+)
- Off-plan CAN count, but ONLY if:
  - The property is **registered with DLD** via Oqood (interim registration)
  - The purchase price (or combined value) meets AED 2M threshold
  - Some interpretations require the property to be at least **50% paid** or at a certain construction stage
  - In practice, many buyers receive Golden Visa with off-plan at early stages, but it depends on the developer and DLD processing

### Standard Property Visa (AED 750K+)
- Generally requires **completed property with title deed**
- Off-plan typically does NOT qualify until handover
- Some emirates and free zones may have different rules

### Practical Timeline for Visa:
| Stage | Golden Visa (2M+) | Property Visa (750K+) |
|---|---|---|
| Off-plan purchase | May qualify with Oqood registration | Generally NO |
| Under construction | Possible with DLD confirmation | Generally NO |
| Handover + title deed | YES | YES |
| Post-handover (mortgage) | YES (if bank is approved) | YES |

## 5. Strategy for 750K Budget

### Recommended Approach:
1. **Immediate:** Purchase off-plan studio at ~750K AED
2. **After handover:** Apply for 2-year property residence visa
3. **Long-term:** If property appreciates OR you purchase additional property to total AED 2M → apply for 5-year Golden Visa

### Alternative Route to Golden Visa:
- If you qualify as a **specialized talent** (engineer in AI, software engineering, biotech, etc.), you can get a 10-year Golden Visa independently of property value
- Salary threshold for executive route: AED 50,000/month

## Summary Table

| Visa Type | Min. Property Value | Duration | Off-Plan OK? | Family? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Golden Visa (Investor) | AED 2,000,000 | 5 years, renewable | Possibly (with conditions) | Spouse + all children + helpers |
| Property Residence Visa | AED 750,000 | 2 years, renewable | NO (need title deed) | Spouse + minor children |
| Standard Investor Visa | AED 2,000,000 (business) | 10 years | N/A | Spouse + all children + helpers |

> **Bottom line:** Your 750K budget qualifies for the 2-year property visa (after handover), NOT the Golden Visa. To get a Golden Visa through real estate, you'd need to invest a total of AED 2M across one or more properties.
