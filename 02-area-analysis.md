## Overview

Dubai's average gross rental yield for apartments sits at **6.5–8.5%** as of 2024-2025, significantly higher than most global cities (London ~3.5%, New York ~3-4%, Singapore ~3-4%). Studios in emerging/affordable areas consistently deliver the HIGHEST yields due to lower purchase prices and strong rental demand from single professionals and young couples.

## Area-by-Area Analysis

### 1. JVC (Jumeirah Village Circle)

| Metric | Data |
|---|---|
| **Average Studio Price (2024-2025)** | AED 450,000 – 750,000 |
| **Average Studio Rent (Annual)** | AED 38,000 – 55,000 |
| **Gross Rental Yield** | **7.5% – 9.2%** |
| **Capital Appreciation (2021-2025)** | +45-55% |
| **Occupancy Rate** | 88-92% |
| **Target Tenant** | Young professionals, couples, freelancers |

**Why JVC:** Most popular area for affordable studios in Dubai. Massive ongoing development with new retail, parks, and community facilities. Central location between Al Barsha and Dubai Sports City. Huge supply of off-plan, which is both an opportunity (choice) and risk (oversupply).

**Key Streets/Sub-areas:** District 10-15 (most popular), Circle Mall area, near Hessa Street exit

**Risks:** Heavy construction, potential oversupply in 2026-2027 due to ~15,000+ units expected for delivery

---

### 2. Dubai Silicon Oasis (DSO)

| Metric | Data |
|---|---|
| **Average Studio Price (Feb 2026, PF)** | AED 760,876 (avg) / 449K–812K range |

| **Total Listings (Feb 2026)** | 123 |
| **Occupancy Rate** | 85-90% |
| **Target Tenant** | Tech workers, students (near universities), budget-conscious professionals |

- Timez by Danube — **842,960 AED**

**Key Sub-areas:** Near Silicon Central Mall, Cedre Villas area, Academic City proximity

**Risks:** Peripheral location (not near metro currently), competition from Dubailand, limited nightlife/lifestyle appeal. Note: -64.86% YoY avg price swing appears distorted by mix shift — price/sqft is a better indicator (+40.54%).

---

---

| **Occupancy Rate** | 85-90% |

**Why International City:** Cheapest studios in Dubai = highest yields. Close to Dragon Mart (massive retail complex). Phase 2 development improving the area.

**Key Clusters:** China Cluster, England Cluster, France Cluster, Phase 2

**Risks:** Poor build quality in older buildings, limited lifestyle amenities, low capital appreciation potential, doesn't meet visa minimum. **Not suitable for 750K budget** (way below).

---

### 5. Al Furjan

| Metric | Data |
|---|---|
| **Average Studio Price (2024-2025)** | AED 450,000 – 700,000 |

| **Capital Appreciation (2021-2025)** | +40-50% |
| **Occupancy Rate** | 88-93% |
| **Target Tenant** | Young professionals, couples, families |

**Why Al Furjan:** Has its own metro station (Route 2020 / Expo line), growing community with improved amenities, close to Discovery Gardens and Ibn Battuta Mall.

**Key Sub-areas:** Near Al Furjan Pavilion, metro station vicinity, near Discovery Gardens

**Risks:** Limited studio supply (more 1-2 bed focus), still building out retail infrastructure

---

### 6. Arjan (Dubai Land / Dubailand)

| Metric | Data |
|---|---|
| **Average Studio Price (2024-2025)** | AED 450,000 – 750,000 |
| **Average Studio Rent (Annual)** | AED 35,000 – 50,000 |
| **Gross Rental Yield** | **7.5% – 8.5%** |
| **Capital Appreciation (2021-2025)** | +40-55% |
| **Occupancy Rate** | 85-90% |
| **Target Tenant** | Young professionals, healthcare workers (near Mediclinic Parkview) |

**Why Arjan:** Rapidly developing area between Motor City and Academic City. Close to Dubai Miracle Garden and Butterfly Garden (tourism). Many new off-plan launches from Samana, Danube, Vincitore in this area. Good highway access.

**Key Streets:** Near Umm Suqeim Road, Al Barsha South, Miracle Garden vicinity

**Risks:** Heavy off-plan supply, area still maturing, limited public transport

---

### 7. Dubai South / Expo City

| Metric | Data |
|---|---|
| **Average Studio Price (2024-2025)** | AED 350,000 – 600,000 |

| **Occupancy Rate** | 75-85% |
| **Target Tenant** | Airport/aviation workers, Expo City employees, logistics professionals |

**Why Dubai South:** Massive government investment. Near Al Maktoum International Airport (set to become world's largest), Expo City repurposed as innovation/business district. Long-term growth story.

**Key Sub-areas:** The Pulse, Emaar South, near Route 2020 metro stations

**Risks:** Still very much a "future bet" — currently low occupancy, far from established Dubai, limited current amenities, dependent on airport expansion timeline

---

### 8. Business Bay

| Metric | Data |
|---|---|
| **Average Studio Price (2024-2025)** | AED 650,000 – 1,200,000 |
| **Average Studio Rent (Annual)** | AED 45,000 – 70,000 |

| **Capital Appreciation (2021-2025)** | +50-65% |
| **Occupancy Rate** | 90-95% |
| **Target Tenant** | Business professionals, corporate housing, tourists (short-term) |

**Why Business Bay:** Premium location adjacent to Downtown Dubai. Canal views available. Walking distance to Burj Khalifa, Dubai Mall. Metro-connected. High demand for short-term rentals.

**Key Streets:** Along Dubai Water Canal, Marasi Drive, near Business Bay metro station, Al Khail Road side

**Risks:** Higher entry price, some studios near/above 750K budget, parking issues, service charges tend to be higher. Lower yield compared to emerging areas.

---

### 9. Dubai Marina

| Metric | Data |
|---|---|
| **Average Studio Price (2024-2025)** | AED 700,000 – 1,500,000 |

| **Capital Appreciation (2021-2025)** | +45-55% |
| **Occupancy Rate** | 92-96% |
| **Target Tenant** | Expat professionals, tourists, high-income singles |

**Why Marina:** Dubai's most iconic residential/lifestyle area. Excellent infrastructure, marina walk, beach access, JBR proximity. Two metro stations. Year-round tourism appeal.

**Budget note:** Some older/smaller studios available from AED 700K, but most quality options are above budget.

**Risks:** Very limited options within 750K. Older buildings may have maintenance issues. Service charges are among the highest in Dubai (AED 15-25/sqft).

---

### 10. Jumeirah Lake Towers (JLT)

| Metric | Data |
|---|---|
| **Average Studio Price (2024-2025)** | AED 550,000 – 900,000 |
| **Average Studio Rent (Annual)** | AED 42,000 – 60,000 |
| **Gross Rental Yield** | **7.0% – 8.0%** |
| **Capital Appreciation (2021-2025)** | +40-50% |
| **Occupancy Rate** | 90-94% |
| **Target Tenant** | Professionals, small business owners, young expats, DMCC free zone workers |

**Why JLT:** One of Dubai's most established freehold communities, JLT sits directly adjacent to Dubai Marina and is organized into 26 clusters around 3 artificial lakes. It offers a lifestyle experience similar to Marina at 20-30% lower prices. Key advantages:

- ✅ **Metro-connected** — Two stations (DMCC and Jumeirah Lake Towers) on the Red Line, excellent public transport
- ✅ **DMCC Free Zone** — Home to 22,000+ companies, generating massive tenant demand from free zone professionals
- ✅ **Lake and SZR views** — Many studios offer views of the JLT lakes, Sheikh Zayed Road, or Marina skyline
- ✅ **Low new supply** — Mostly a completed community, meaning very limited new off-plan competing with your resale/rental — strong supply-demand dynamics
- ✅ **Walkable lifestyle** — Restaurants, cafes, supermarkets, gyms, and retail in every cluster; direct walking access to Marina and JBR beach
- ✅ **Affordable Marina alternative** — Similar lifestyle to Dubai Marina with 20-30% lower price per sqft
- ✅ **Strong rental demand** — Consistent demand from DMCC employees, media/internet city workers, and young professionals
- ✅ **Established community** — Mature infrastructure with well-maintained common areas, known service charge levels, and established tenant base

**Key Clusters & Sub-areas:**
- **Cluster D, E, Y, W** — Lake-facing, premium locations, higher rents
- **Cluster J, K, O, R** — SZR-facing, city views, moderate pricing
- **Near DMCC Metro** — Walking distance to metro commands 5-10% rent premium
- **Almas Tower area** — Commercial hub, drives corporate tenant demand

**Studio Price Breakdown (Within Budget):**
- AED 550,000-650,000: Smaller studios (300-350 sqft), interior-facing, older buildings
- AED 650,000-750,000: Mid-size studios (350-420 sqft), lake or partial SZR views, well-maintained clusters
- AED 750,000-900,000: Premium studios (400-500 sqft), full lake/marina views, high floors

**Comparison to Dubai Marina:**
| Factor | JLT | Dubai Marina |
|---|---|---|
| Studio price (avg) | AED 650K | AED 900K |
| Rental yield | 7.0-8.0% | 6.0-7.0% |
| Metro access | ✅ (2 stations) | ✅ (2 stations) |
| Beach access | Walking (10 min to JBR) | Walking (5 min to JBR) |
| Lifestyle | 8/10 | 9.5/10 |
| Service charges | AED 12-18/sqft | AED 15-25/sqft |
| Supply risk | 🟢 Very Low | 🟢 Very Low |

**Risks:**
- ⚠️ **Parking challenges** — JLT has chronic parking shortages in popular clusters; some buildings have limited visitor parking
- ⚠️ **Mixed-use clusters** — Commercial + residential mix means some buildings can be noisy during business hours
- ⚠️ **Building quality variance** — Older buildings (2007-2010 era) may have maintenance issues; quality varies significantly between clusters
- ⚠️ **Limited off-plan options** — Very few new projects launching in JLT; mostly secondary market purchases
- ⚠️ **Service charge disputes** — Some clusters have experienced service charge increases and owner-association conflicts
- ⚠️ **Competition from Marina** — For premium tenants, Marina often wins; JLT attracts more price-sensitive renters

**Investment Verdict:** JLT is a **strong contender for the 750K budget** — especially for investors who want metro access, established infrastructure, low supply risk, and reliable rental demand. The main trade-off is that you're buying secondary market (ready property) rather than off-plan, meaning you won't get developer payment plans but you CAN start earning rent immediately and qualify for the property visa right away. For investors prioritizing **capital preservation and steady income over speculative appreciation**, JLT is arguably the safest choice in this budget range.

### 11. Jumeirah Village Triangle (JVT)

| Metric | Data |
|---|---|
| **Average Studio Price (2024-2025)** | AED 420,000 – 750,000 |
| **Average Studio Rent (Annual)** | AED 45,000 – 60,000 (avg ~54,000) |
| **Gross Rental Yield** | **7.5% – 8.5%** |
| **Capital Appreciation (2021-2025)** | +35-45% |
| **Occupancy Rate** | 87-91% |
| **Target Tenant** | Families, young professionals, couples seeking quiet community |

**Why JVT:** Jumeirah Village Triangle is a freehold gated community developed by Nakheel, located between Al Khail Road (E44) and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Road (E311). **JVT is a separate area from JVC (Jumeirah Village Circle) and JLT (Jumeirah Lake Towers)** — though JVT sits adjacent to JVC and shares some characteristics.

- ✅ **Nakheel-developed master plan** — established developer with proven infrastructure delivery
- ✅ **Family-friendly gated community** — parks, tennis courts, basketball courts, landscaped walkways
- ✅ **Mix of property types** — villas, townhouses, and apartments create a balanced residential feel (not just towers)
- ✅ **Competitive pricing** — studios from AED 420K-750K, with recent transactions at AED 45,000-60,000/year rent
- ✅ **Spacious studios** — many units range from 368-642 sqft, larger than typical JVC/Arjan studios
- ✅ **Near JVC and Dubai Production City** — benefits from JVC's growing retail/amenities without the same density
- ✅ **Strong off-plan activity** — new launches like Binghatti Luxuria JVT bringing modern product to the area
- ✅ **Good highway access** — Al Khail Road and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Road connections

**Key Sub-areas:**
- Near Al Khail Road side — better connectivity, closer to JVC amenities
- Central JVT — quieter, more residential feel, parks access
- Near Dubai Production City — budget-friendly, growing retail

**Studio Price Breakdown (Within Budget):**
- AED 420,000-550,000: Older/smaller studios, interior-facing
- AED 550,000-650,000: Mid-range studios (400-500 sqft), community views
- AED 650,000-750,000: Premium/new studios, Binghatti Luxuria JVT off-plan range

**Notable Off-Plan Project:**
- **Binghatti Luxuria JVT** — Launch price from AED 766K, studios 360-430 sqft, handover July 2027, payment plan 20/50/30, freehold

**Risks:**
- ⚠️ **Moderate new supply** — some off-plan activity including Binghatti Luxuria and other launches, but significantly less than JVC. Estimated pipeline of 2,000-3,000 units (vs JVC's 15,000+)
- ⚠️ **No metro access** — not currently served by Dubai Metro; relies on car/bus transport
- ⚠️ **Less established than JVC** — fewer retail/dining options within JVT itself; residents often drive to JVC or Ibn Battuta
- ⚠️ **Mixed development stage** — some parts of JVT still have vacant plots and ongoing construction
- ⚠️ **Brand confusion** — tenants/buyers sometimes confuse JVT with JVC, which can affect marketing

**Investment Verdict:** JVT offers a **quieter, more community-oriented alternative to JVC** with competitive pricing and strong rental yields. The Nakheel master plan provides infrastructure confidence. Supply risk is moderate — significantly lower than JVC's massive pipeline. Best suited for investors who want a family-friendly area with solid fundamentals and don't need metro access.

### 12. Motor City

| Metric | Data |
|---|---|
| **Average Studio Price (2024-2025)** | AED 400,000 – 650,000 |
| **Average Studio Rent (Annual)** | AED 37,500 – 70,000 (avg ~56,000) |
| **Gross Rental Yield** | **9.0% – 10.5%** |
| **Capital Appreciation (2021-2025)** | +25-35% |
| **Occupancy Rate** | 89-93% |
| **Target Tenant** | Motorsport enthusiasts, families, pet owners, budget-conscious professionals |

**Why Motor City:** A budget-friendly, family-oriented community developed by Union Properties, centered around the Dubai Autodrome (motorsport circuit) and Kartodrome. Motor City is divided into three zones — Uptown Motor City, Green Community, and Business Park — each with its own character.

- ✅ **Spacious studios** — typical units are 600-880 sqft, significantly larger than studios in JVC, Arjan, or Business Bay (often 50-100% bigger)
- ✅ **Excellent value for money** — lower price per sqft means more space for your AED
- ✅ **Strong rental yields** — averaging ~10.2% gross due to low purchase prices and solid rental demand
- ✅ **Mostly built out** — limited new supply means less competition for your rental unit; supply risk is LOW
- ✅ **Family and pet friendly** — green surroundings, parks, community feel, pet-friendly buildings
- ✅ **Unique attractions** — Dubai Autodrome, Kartodrome, and motorsport events create niche tenant demand
- ✅ **Off Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Road (E311)** — highway access to major Dubai areas
- ✅ **Near Arabian Ranches and Sports City** — benefits from nearby established communities

**Key Sub-areas:**
- **Uptown Motor City** — residential towers, most studio options here
- **Green Community** — villas and townhouses (premium segment)
- **Business Park** — commercial + some residential

**Studio Price Breakdown (Within Budget):**
- AED 400,000-500,000: Older studios (600-700 sqft), good condition, established buildings
- AED 500,000-600,000: Renovated/well-maintained studios (700-880 sqft), community views
- AED 600,000-650,000: Premium studios, higher floors, best views

**Notable New Development:**
- **The Community Motor City** by Aqua Properties — new development offering studios to 3BR, bringing modern product to an established area

**Risks:**
- ⚠️ **No direct metro access** — relies entirely on car/bus transport; nearest metro is a significant drive
- ⚠️ **Aging building stock** — most buildings are from the 2008-2012 era; some may need renovation
- ⚠️ **Lower capital appreciation** — established, built-out areas typically see slower price growth (30% over 5 years vs. 45-55% for JVC/Arjan)
- ⚠️ **Limited nightlife/lifestyle** — quiet residential area; not suited for tenants seeking vibrant social scene
- ⚠️ **Union Properties developer** — the original developer has faced financial difficulties; however, existing buildings are well-established

**Investment Verdict:** Motor City is a **hidden gem for yield-focused investors**. The combination of low purchase prices, large studio sizes, and limited new supply creates one of the highest gross yields in Dubai (~10.2%). It won't deliver the capital appreciation of Business Bay or JVC, but the steady income, low supply risk, and established community make it an excellent choice for conservative investors prioritizing cash flow over speculation.

### 13. Discovery Gardens

| Metric | Data |
|---|---|
| **Average Studio Price (2024-2025)** | AED 280,000 – 450,000 |
| **Average Studio Rent (Annual)** | AED 25,000 – 38,000 |
| **Gross Rental Yield** | **8.0% – 9.5%** |
| **Capital Appreciation (2021-2025)** | +25-35% |
| **Occupancy Rate** | 85-90% |
| **Target Tenant** | Budget tenants, families, South Asian workforce |

**Why Discovery Gardens:** Very affordable, near Ibn Battuta Mall and metro station, Nakheel community. Good yields.

**Risks:** Aging buildings (2000s-era), limited premium appeal, below visa minimum for most units. **Not suitable for 750K budget** — priced way below.

---

### 14. MBR City (Mohammed Bin Rashid City) / District 2020

| Metric | Data |
|---|---|
| **Average Studio Price (2024-2025)** | AED 600,000 – 1,000,000 |
| **Average Studio Rent (Annual)** | AED 40,000 – 60,000 |
| **Gross Rental Yield** | **6.5% – 7.5%** |
| **Capital Appreciation (2021-2025)** | +55-70% |
| **Occupancy Rate** | 85-90% |
| **Target Tenant** | Families, professionals, those seeking newer communities |

**Why MBR City:** Massive master-planned community. Sobha Hartland is the flagship. Close to Meydan, Downtown, and Ras Al Khor wildlife sanctuary. Significant government investment.

**Key Sub-areas:** Sobha Hartland, Sobha Hartland II, District One, near Meydan Racecourse

**Risks:** Still developing (lots of construction), higher-end positioning means less yield. Limited studios — developers focus on 1-3 bed apartments and villas.

---

### 15. Wasl Gate

| Metric | Data |
|---|---|
| **Average Studio Price (Feb 2026)** | AED 577,500 – 850,000 |
| **Average Studio Price (PropertyFinder)** | AED 645,722 |
| **Average Price/sqft** | AED 1,552 |
| **YoY Price Change** | +1.8% (Avg price), +2.7% (per sqft) |
| **Total Listings** | 45 |
| **Key Buildings** | Hills View, Hammock Park, South Garden A/B/C, Taiyo Residences, Sola Residences, The Nook 2 |
| **Target Tenant** | Healthcare workers, families, professionals near Creek & Healthcare City |

**Why Wasl Gate:**
- **Government-backed developer** — Wasl Asset Management Group (owned by Dubai's ruling family) develops and manages the community, providing long-term stability and quality assurance
- **Strategic location** — Near Al Jadaf, Dubai Healthcare City, and Dubai Creek, with easy access to Downtown Dubai (10-15 min drive)
- **Blue Line Metro proximity** — The upcoming Blue Line extension will serve Al Jadaf/Healthcare City area, boosting connectivity and values
- **Healthcare City adjacency** — Massive demand driver from medical professionals, patients' families, and healthcare workers
- **Dubai Creek proximity** — Cultural and heritage significance, plus the upcoming Dubai Creek Tower/Harbour mega-development
- **Moderate pricing** — Average 645K with entry from ~577K (The Nook 2), offering reasonable value vs more established areas
- **Newer buildings** — Most towers are recently completed or under construction, meaning modern finishes and lower maintenance

**Key Projects:**
- **Hammock Park** — Ready, 394-395 sqft, 740K-850K (premium positioning)
- **Hills View** — Off-plan/near-ready, 425-458 sqft, 625K-825K range
- **South Garden A/B/C** — Ready, 438 sqft, 599K-750K (best value picks)
- **Taiyo Residences** — Off-plan, ~400 sqft, 639K
- **Sola Residences** — Off-plan, 386-387 sqft, 722K-794K
- **The Nook 2** — Avg 577K (lowest entry point in Wasl Gate)

**Risks:**
- Still developing — limited retail/dining options within the community itself
- Smaller community with fewer listings (45 vs 2,750 in JVC) — less liquidity
- No published rental yield data on PropertyFinder — market still maturing
- Moderate YoY appreciation (+1.8%) compared to high-growth areas like Motor City (+32.8%)
- Some projects are off-plan with uncertain handover timing

**Investment Verdict:** Wasl Gate is a **long-term government-backed play**. The low supply, stable pricing, and upcoming metro access make it interesting for patient investors. However, it lacks the proven rental track record and yield data of more established areas like JVC, Arjan, or DSO. Best suited for investors who value developer quality and location fundamentals over immediate yield.
