#### OBJECT 1
| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| **Founded** | ~2021 |
| **On-Time Delivery** | ❓ No delivery track record yet |
| **Build Quality** | ❓ Unknown |
| **Studios in Budget?** | ✅ |
| **Verdict** | Too new to evaluate. HIGH RISK. Avoid unless pricing is exceptionally compelling and escrow protections are verified. |

#### WADAN Developments 🚩
| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| **Founded** | Unknown (recently established) |
| **Notable Projects** | Tresora (JVC) — first known project |
| **On-Time Delivery** | ❓ **No delivery track record whatsoever** |
| **Build Quality** | ❓ **Unknown — zero completed projects to evaluate** |
| **Service Charges** | ❓ Unknown — no delivered buildings to reference |
| **Resale Value** | ❓ Very poor — no brand recognition, near-zero resale liquidity |
| **Studios in Budget?** | ✅ Starting from AED 670K |
| **Post-Handover Plans** | Yes — Option B offers 30% post-handover |
| **Key Areas** | JVC |
| **Unique Selling Point** | Lower pricing and post-handover payment plan |
| **Verdict** | **🚩 HIGH RISK — NOT RECOMMENDED.** Zero track record, unknown management team, no delivered projects. The attractive payment plan (including post-handover) does not compensate for fundamental developer risk. JVC oversupply means even if delivered, competing against established developers' products. Escrow protections offer some safety on deposited funds, but delays and quality issues are unpredictable. Only consider if you have very high risk tolerance AND can afford to lose the investment timeline. |

|---|---|---|---|
| Tiger | 10-15 | 4,000-6,000 | 9-13% |
| Binghatti | 12-17 | 4,800-6,800 | 11-15% |
| Danube | 12-18 | 4,800-7,200 | 11-16% |
| Azizi | 12-18 | 4,800-7,200 | 11-16% |

| Sobha | 14-20 | 5,600-8,000 | 12-18% |
| Emaar | 15-22 | 6,000-8,800 | 13-20% |
| Ellington | 16-22 | 6,400-8,800 | 14-20% |
| DAMAC | 18-28 | 7,200-11,200 | 16-25% |

> **Key insight:** DAMAC's high service charges can eat 5-10% more of your rental income compared to Binghatti or Danube. Factor this into yield calculations!
